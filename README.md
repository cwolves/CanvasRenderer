#    Canvas Renderer
#### JavaScript HTML-to-Canvas Renderer

The purpose of this script is to allow "screenshots" to be taken of any page.  These "screenshots" are created by re-rendering every visible DOM element into a new canvas.  Because of this re-rendering, screenshots are not 100% accurate, but aim to be as close as possible.

### Browser Compatibility
This script should work fine in the following browsers:

* Firefox 3+
* Google Chrome

Support is planned for the following:

* IE 7+ (IE < 9 support via flashCanvas)
* Opera

Examples:
